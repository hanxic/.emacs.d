My Emacs configuration
This emacs configuration currently can be used for programming in the following environments
* Coq (Fully)
* OCaml (Fully)
* Org (In Progress)
* LaTeX (In Progress)
* MarkDown (In Progress)
## Future Plans:
Currently, I am planning to add more programming environments
- [] Haskell
- [] LLVM

## Reference
The configuration is working due to the tutorial of [Emacs From Scratch](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch)
